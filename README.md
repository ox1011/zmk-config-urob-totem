# zmk-config

This is my personal [zmk-config](https://zmk.dev/) for my Split keyboards. <br />
Sweep Bluethooth(Nice!Nano) or Dongle(Nice!Naon), Studio available. <br />
Totem Bluethooth(Xiao_ble) or Dongle(Xiao_ble), Studio available.<br /><br />

Uses Urob's Timeless-Home-row-mods.<br />
Provides RShift on the Default layer R4 row.<br />

The thumb, number, symbol, and function layers follow the Miryoku layout almost exactly.<br />

The number layer provides the four basic arithmetic operations as combo keys, just like a full-size keyboard.<br />

There are symbol layers, but frequently used symbols are provided as combos. Function keys are provided on the opposite side of the symbol layers to reduce the layer key, and modifier keys are provided for shortcuts.<br />

The navigation layer replaces the action of tapping the arrow keys multiple times with a hold. On the opposite side of the navigation keys are frequently used shortcuts like Copy, Task Switcher, etc.<br />

## Modules

Additional features are provided by the following [modules](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/modules): <br />

- [**zmk-rgbled-widgets**](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-rgbled-widget) to show the connection and battery status with the built-in LEDs of the Xiao BLE controller.
- [**zmk-smart-toggle**](https://github.com/caksoylar/zmk-smart-toggle) custom behavior module that implements a "smart toggle" key. Used in Swapper.
